- **Event Processing**: Efficient subscription management
- **UI Updates**: Automatic batched updates
- **Constraint Checking**: O(1) for most operations

## 🔧 Integration Patterns

### Framework Integration
```javascript
// React integration pattern
const [timeController] = useState(() => TimeController(options));
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = timeController.events.timeSelected.subscribe(callback);
  return unsubscribe;
}, []);

// Vue integration pattern
const timeController = reactive(TimeController(options));
watch(() => timeController.bindings.selectedTime.current, callback);

// Angular integration pattern
timeController.events.timeSelected.subscribe(time => this.selectedTime = time);
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// External calendar sync
const appointments = await fetchAppointments();
timeController.methods.setDisabledTimes(appointments.map(a => a.startTime));

// Validation with business rules
const isValid = timeController.methods.isTimeValid(time) && 
                customBusinessRules.validate(time);
```
